# Springboot Thymeleaf MVC
This is a test repository for working with [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot),
[Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/), and [PostqreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
Database via [Jpa](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/jpa-137156.html)
and [Hibernate ORM](http://hibernate.org/).

The build system uses the [Gradle Build Tool](https://gradle.org/). The final
artifacts can be run directly from the command line, or installed on a server
assuming Java is available system wide.

[SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) runs an embedded 
[Tomcat Server](https://tomcat.apache.org/) so there is no requirement to install
[Tomcat Server](https://tomcat.apache.org/) system wide just for testing.

## TO-DO
* [ ] Finish updating Ticket Controller and Views.
* [ ] Add jQuery validation for Staff entry form.
